COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
The purpose of the course is to facilitate the learner to: 
1. Understand and implement dynamic memory management techniques in C. 
2. Apply linear data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists) to solve computational 
problems. 
3. Analyse and utilize non-linear data structures such as trees and graphs for 
applications. 
4. Design practical solutions to real-world problems using suitable data structures. 
Program 1 – Weekly Planner  
A student needs a simple Weekly Planner System to keep track of their weekly schedule. 
For each day, the planner should store:  name of the day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday…), date 
of the day (numeric format) and the activity planned for that day (e.g., class, event, 
meeting). 
Develop a C program to implement this weekly planner using the following functions. 
a. create() to initialize the weekly planner.  
b. read() to input the details (day name, date, activity) from the user. 
c. display() to generate and print the Weekly Activity Report on screen. 
Program 2 –Pattern Matching 
A publishing company is developing a simple tool to edit documents by replacing certain 
words or phrases. Design a C program that performs find-and-replace operations on text 
without using built-in string functions. 
a. Read a main string (STR), a pattern string (PAT), and a replacement string (REP) from 
the user. 
b. Search the main string for all occurrences of PAT. 
c. Replace every occurrence of PAT in STR with REP. 
d. If PAT does not exist in STR, display an appropriate message. 
Program 3- Parcel Storage System 
A courier office needs a simple Parcel Storage System to manage parcels efficiently. Each 
parcel is assigned an integer ID for identification. Design a C program that supports the 
following operations: 
a. push() – Add a parcel ID onto the stack when a new parcel arrives. 
b. pop() – Remove the last parcel ID from the stack when a parcel is taken out. 
c. display() – Show all parcel IDs currently stored in the stack. 
d. Display suitable messages when the stack is full (overflow) or empty (underflow).

Program 4 - Calculator Application 
In modern calculators, mathematical expressions are usually entered in infix notation, where 
operators are written between operands (e.g., 3 + 4 * 2). However, calculators and computer 
systems evaluate these expressions more efficiently in postfix notation, where operators 
follow operands (e.g., 3 4 2 * +).  
To simulate this process, develop a C program that converts any valid infix expression into 
its equivalent postfix expression. The program should support alphanumeric operands and 
the following operators: -, +, *, /, %, ^. 
Program 5 - Call Center Help Desk 
A call center assigns a ticket number to every incoming call. Since only a limited number 
of calls can be handled at a time, the calls are placed in a queue. When a representative 
becomes free, the next call in the queue is served. 
Design and implement a C program to simulate this system using a circular queue. The 
program should support the following operations: 
a. Add a new call to the queue (enqueue) 
b. Serve the next call (dequeue) 
c. Display all waiting calls 
The program must also handle queue overflow and underflow conditions properly. 
Program 6 - Student Information Management System 
A university wants to maintain a dynamic record of its students for academic and 
administrative purposes. Each student record contains the following details: USN, Name, 
Programme, Semester, and Phone Number. Since the number of students may vary 
frequently due to admissions and withdrawals, a singly linked list (SLL) is chosen for 
efficient memory usage and flexible data management. 
To simulate this system, develop a menu-driven C program that performs the following 
operations on the student database: 
a. Create a Singly Linked List of N student records using front insertion. 
b. Display all student records and count the number of nodes in the list. 
c. Insert or delete a student record at the end of the list. 
d. Insert or delete a student record at the front of the list (demonstrating stack 
operations). 
Program 7 - Employee Record Management System 
A company maintains details of its employees for administrative and payroll purposes. Each 
employee record contains the following fields: SSN, Name, Department, Designation, 
Salary, and Phone Number. Since employees may frequently join, leave, or change 
positions, a Doubly Linked List (DLL) provides a flexible way to manage these records 
efficiently in both directions. 
To simulate this process, design and implement a menu-driven C program that performs the 
following operations on the employee database:

a. Create a Doubly Linked List of N employee records using end insertion. 
b. Display all employee records and count the total number of nodes. 
c. Insert or delete an employee record at the end of the list. 
d. Insert or delete an employee record at the front of the list. 
e. Demonstrate how the DLL can be used as a Double Ended Queue (Deque). 
 
Program 8 – Library Book Management System 
Design and implement a menu-driven C program to manage a Library Book Database using 
a Binary Search Tree (BST). Each record should store the following details: ISBN Number 
and Book Title.  
The program should support the following operations: 
a. Insert a new book into the BST 
b. Traverse the BST using Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder 
c. Search for a book by its ISBN number and print the title. 
 
Program 9 - City Connectivity using Graph Traversal 
In a city transportation system, each city can be represented as a node and the direct roads 
between them as edges of a graph. To analyse connectivity, it is important to know which 
cities can be reached from a given starting city. 
Develop a C program to: 
a. Represent N cities using an Adjacency Matrix 
b. Display all cities reachable from a specified city using DFS or BFS traversal. 
 
Program 10 - Collision Handling in Vehicle Registration System 
In a vehicle registration system, each vehicle is assigned a unique 4-digit registration 
number. To support quick storage and retrieval, these records are organized in a hash table 
with m storage locations. 
Develop a C program to: 
1. Store vehicle registration numbers in the hash table using linear probing and quadratic 
probing for collision handling. 
2. Display the final state of the hash table after all insertions. 
 
Mini Project 
a. 
Students must form teams of 2 to 3 members. 
b. 
Each team must identify and finalize a real-world problem that can be solved 
using appropriate data structures. 
c. 
Teams must analyze the problem and design the solution using suitable data 
structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, or graphs. 
d. 
The project must be implemented entirely in C language.
